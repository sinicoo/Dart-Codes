# Dart Code Compilation (2022-2023)

A collection of Dart programs developed during my 2nd year of Computer Science college (2022-2023). These projects focus on fundamental programming concepts and showcase a range of simple applications that helped me build a solid foundation in Dart programming.

## Programs Included

1. **Guessing Game**: A simple game where the player guesses a randomly generated number within a certain range. Great for practicing loops and conditional statements.

2. **Passcode Program**: Implements basic password entry and validation, simulating a simple authentication process.

3. **Password Generator**: Creates secure passwords based on user-defined criteria, utilizing randomization and string manipulation techniques.

4. **Simple Calculator**: A basic calculator for performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with user input.

5. **Student Detail Program**: Collects and displays information about a student, showcasing the use of data structures and string formatting.

## Purpose

These programs were created to explore core programming concepts such as:
- Input/Output handling
- Conditional logic
- Looping structures
- Basic data handling and formatting
- Simple mathematical and random operations
